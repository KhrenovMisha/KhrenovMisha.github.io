                        <p>Nanachi (ナナチ, Nanachi) is a Narehate; a person who survived the 6th
                            layer's
                            Curse
                            of
                            the Abyss, and was
                            left
                            deformed
                            as a result, but, unlike most other Narehate, still retained a sound mind. Possessing vast
                            knowledge
                            of
                            the
                            Abyss -

                            Riko's
                            party,
                            assisting
                            her in reaching the bottom of the Abyss. Her gender is ambiguous.</p></div>

                        <h2>Appearance</h2>
                        <p>Nanachi's appearance is very rabbit-like, save for a long sturdy tail, horizontally
                            slanted pupils,
                            carnivorous
                            teeth
                            and human-like hair; which is straight and white or cream in a short bobbed style, the sides
                            of
                            the
                            bangs
                            going
                            down
                            to the shoulders. In contrast, medium tan fur covers the rest of Nanachi, with light tan
                            covering
                            the
                            insides of
                            their
                            ears and belly. They have a blush-like spot on each cheek; which has two thick whiskers
                            protruding
                            sideways.
                            Other
                            animal traits include a cat-like mouth with little fangs, yellow eyes with horizontal oval
                            shaped
                            pupils
                            (similar to
                            a goat's) and erect bunny ears. Their fingers are rather stubby.</p>
                        <p>Nanachi's attire consists solely of gray-green, baggy, drop-crotch harem pants, with
                            dark-pink
                            hip-bags
                            on
                            both
                            sides,
                            red pant legs, and a pink flap that is supposed to cover their usually naked torso.</p>
                        <p>Nanachi also wears a large, oddly-shaped headpiece the same colors as their pants. Attached
                            to
                            the
                            sides
                            of
                            it
                            are two curved horns that stick out horizontally. Hanging from the back there is a large
                            layer
                            of
                            what
                            appears
                            to be shingles, covered by a layer of cream-colored animal pelts, and then another smaller
                            layer
                            of
                            shingles.
                            Strangely, Nanachi's side bangs seem to be much longer when the helmet is on, going down to
                            their
                            hips.
                            They
                            are tied at the end with metal rings. It is likely that these hair extensions are a part of
                            the
                            headpiece.</p>
                        <p>They typically walk upright, but sometimes will run on all fours if they are trying to move
                            quickly.</p>

                        <h2>Personality</h2>
                        <p>Most of the time Nanachi is cool and reserved, keeping their distance
                            emotionally
                            and
                            physically. Their
                            attitude
                            often
                            borders on being sarcastic and even cynical, however behind this mask, Nanachi hides a kind
                            and
                            gentle
                            soul,
                            capable
                            of deep compassion and selfless devotion. They are also quite bashful when complimented,
                            seen in
                            their
                            reaction
                            to
                            being called "fluffy". They also express discomfort at being petted, especially by Reg.</p>

                    <p>Nanachi has demonstrated advanced tracking and stalking skills; when Reg and Riko first entered

                        4th

                        location. They
                        were
                        capable of tracking Reg and Riko throughout their journey in the 4th layer, continuing to remain
                        hidden,
                        until
                        they voluntarily revealed themself upon seeing Reg scream when he thought that Riko had
                        died.</p></li>

                    <h4>Curse Detection</h4>
                    <p>On top of top-notch tracking and stalking skills, since becoming a Narehate, Nanachi has been
                        able to see
                        the
                        flow
                        of the Curse of the Abyss — a mysterious force that is behind the ailments human beings suffers
                        upon
                        attempting
                        to ascend from the Abyss. Thus, they are capable of avoiding it.</p></li>

                    <h4>Extensive Knowledge</h4>
                    <p>Aside from their skills granted to them by their Narehate nature, Nanachi has been shown to be
                        deeply
                        knowledgeable
                        about the flora and fauna within the Abyss; they are capable of determining what is edible, as
                        well as
                        if
                        something
                        has any medicinal properties. Their time spent in Ido Front has also lead to them knowing how to
                        perform
                        some complex
                        surgeries. Using this knowledge, Nanachi has tended to myriads of maladies that Delvers may
                        suffer from,
                        such as
                        being able to splint broken arms, suture open wounds, and even creating an antidote for Orb
                        Piercer
                        venom.
                        Many
                        of the curative methods and medicines they use are unknown even to Delvers, who are often
                        thought of to
                        be
                        the
                        most knowledgeable of the Abyss.</p></li>

                    <h4>Artistic Talent</h4>
                    <p>Nanachi is also shown to be artistically talented, having demonstrated excellent ability in
                        drawing. They
                        have
                        drawn pictures of themself, Mitty, Reg, and Riko; a representation of how the curse works for
                        Reg; and
                        accurate
                        depictions of the things they required Reg to fetch in order to aid them in healing Riko's
